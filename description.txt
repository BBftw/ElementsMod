~ Power of the Elements ~

This is a mod planned to include lots of custom content in the distant future. Currently it includes this content:

 - Magmite (A new material). Currently the ore does not spawn 
   so you'll have to get it through Cheat Sheet or something
 - Magmite ore and bar
 - A Magmite sword that shoots explosive projectiles
 - An unfinished Magmite magic staff that shoots piercing 
   flying lava rocks


Planned content includes:

 - A boss
 - An invasion
 - 4 new materials (including Magmite) and weapon/tool/armour
   sets to go with them
